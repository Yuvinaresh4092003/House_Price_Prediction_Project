# House_Price_Prediction_Project
Hello everyone, this is my project in which i have made a ML model which effictively predicts the house price in Bangalore based on various parameters such as total_sqft_area, BHK and number of bathrooms. I have used python flask server to integrate my ML model and the columns.json file into a website and create a beautiful UI.

Hope you like it:)
